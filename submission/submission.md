## Implementation

### Token tracking
The best trading signals are generated with the most accurate events and information about the tokens available. We decided to track the 3 most traded tokens in the Monad Testnet, which are Molandak (DAK), Moyaki (YAKI), and Chog (CHOG).<br>
We acquire information regarding transfers, spikes, new listings, token holders, tokens price evolution, and the native token MON price. These information are fetched via 4 different services:
- **Envio**: transfers, spikes, listings
- **Codex**: tokens price
- **Blockvision**: token holders
- **Pyth**: MON price

All the data are then stored on MongoDB (except for the MON price which is rendered on the frontend).

### Data polling
The raw data stored on MongoDB are then fetched every 30 minutes by the Signal Agent, which will query each collections and will fetch only the newly added events. Langchain's text splitter has been used for converting those events into machine readable vectors via the OpenAI Embeddings. Those embeddings are then stored in a Supabase database for the next step.

### Signal generation
The signal generation process has been created with Langchain. This tool helped us to structure a chain of prompts that translates an input prompt into an actionable and coherent trading signal. Thanks to the `match_documents` function on Supabase database, we are able to find the best events for the input prompt given. These events will then serve as the context for the generated signal.

### Nillion's Secret Vault
All the signals are stored in a decentralized database provided by Nillion. Thanks to Nillion, we are able to guarantee the encryption of both the trading signal text and the events that generated it, granting exclusive access only to those users that purchased the Gorillionaire Access NFT.
